# Neighborhood Map
##
### Overview

This is the 6th project in Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree. The objective is to develop an interactive map in your neighborhood based on Google Map and get information of different locations by asynchronous call from API. To be specific, in this project I listed some famous restaurants in my neighborhood and by calling Yelp API, I provide the link, picture and review for the restaurants. 

This project introduces JavaScript, AJAX and API call concepts to the fronend design. By using the JS framework KnockoutJS, the webpage design can be significantly improved.
